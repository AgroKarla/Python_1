# Python 1 – Programming Logic

This repository contains my first exercises in Python, focused on learning the basics of programming logic and data types. It is part of my self-taught training to become a data analyst, with a focus on agricultural data.

## 📂 Contents

- `00_sintaxis_variables_tipos_de_datos.py`  
  Basic Python syntax, variable declaration, and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).

- `01_operadores.py`  
  Practice with arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

## 🎯 Learning Objective

To build a solid foundation in structured programming using Python, as a first step toward data science and data analysis in the agricultural sector.

## 🧭 Next Topics

- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Data structures (`list`, `dict`, `set`)
- Input handling and basic algorithms
- Code organization with modules
